It might be frustrating since the doc [using plugins](https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins/) doesn\u2019t contain successful packaging examples. \\n\\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll guide you through the process of packing your Answer plugin with step-by-step tutorial. \\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nTo get started, please make sure you have a development environment set up with the following: Node.js, pnpm, Docker, Go etc. Don\u2019t forget to check the official documentation for [development guide](https://answer.apache.org/docs/development/).\\n\\n## Notice\\n\\n**Skip this section if you\u2019re using the latest code.**\\n\\nIn Answer 1.3.5, the plugin build process and some plugin commands have been adjusted. If you are using code from before 1.3.5, you need to change the basic information of some internal plugins. The plugins involved are:\\n\\n1. editor-chart\\n2. editor-formula\\n3. embed-basic (only available 1.3.5 and later)\\n\\nFind the [commit ID](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/commit/e224fee9b8a0b936e143e852050d9345aa249201) for the plugin you need to update. In its package.json files, the hyphens (-) in the plugin name with underscores (\\\\_). For instance:\\n![image.png](01.webp)\\n\\n## I. Build Docker Images with Plugins\\nThere\u2019re two ways to build Docker images with plugins:\\n1. Answer Base Image\\n2. Local Code\\n\\n\\n### Build from Answer Base Image \\nIf there\u2019s no need to modify Answer\'s source code, you can build directly from official base images. Please check our [docs](https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins/#build-with-plugin-from-answer-base-image) on building with plugin from answer base image.\\n\\n### Build Docker Images From Local Code\\nPlease keep local code up-to-date. The steps are as below:\\n\\n1. **Add Pluins**\uff1aEdit `/script/plugin_list` (root directory) and add plugin repository URLs (one per line).\\n2. **Build Docker Image**\uff1aRun command: `docker build -t <image_name[:tag]> .` .\\n3. **Launch and Verify**\uff1aWait for build to finish, then run `docker run -d -p 9080:80 -v answer-data:/data --name <container_name> <image_name>`, then verify plugins in Answer \u3002\\n\\n### 1.Add Required Plugins\\n```\\ngithub.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-basic@latest\\ngithub.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/reviewer-basic@latest\\ngithub.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/captcha-basic@latest\\ngithub.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/editor-formula@latest\\n\\n```\\n\\n### 2.Build Docker Image\\n\\nThe build process may take some time.\\n![docker build process](docker-build.webp)\\n\\n### 3.Local Start up and Verification\\nRun the following command to start locally and follow the [documentation](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation#install-steps) to complete initialization. \\n\\n```\\ndocker run -d -p 9080:80 -v answer-data:/data --name answer101 answer-plugin\\n```\\n\\nAfter initialization, log in to the admin panel and see if the plugin runs correctly.\\n\\nAdmin Panel\\n![installed plugins](installed-plugins.webp)\\n\\nActivate the Plugin\\n![active a plugin](active-plugin.webp)\\n\\nVerify Plugin(editor-formula) Functionality\uff1a\\n![confirm formula plugin result](formula-res.webp)\\n\\n\\n## II. Build a Binary with Plugins\\n\\nHere, we will walk you through the process of building an Apache Answer binary that includes specific plugins. The process involves building the base binary, incorporating the required plugins, locally verifying the plugins, and finally deploying the binary.\\n\\n### Steps   \\n1. Build Base Binary\\n2. Build Plugin Binary\\n3. Verify\\n4. Deploy\\n\\n### 1.Build Base Binary\\n\\nStart with building the front-end static resources using the command `make ui`.\\n\\nOutput:\\n1. Installing Dependencies\\n![install ui dependence](make-ui-01.webp)\\n2. Dependency InstallationBuilding Static Resources after Dependency Installation\\n![build ui static files](make-ui-02.webp)\\n\\nTo build the base binary, run `make build`. If the build is successful, the answer binary will be generated in the project root directory.\\n\\nIf you encounter errors related to Go dependency installation, you can try running `go mod download` locally to see if the installation is successful. If it still fails, consider configuring a domestic mirror: https://goproxy.cn/ or enabling a network proxy.\\n\\nSuccess\uff1a\\n![build binary success](make-ui-03.webp)\\n\\n### 2.Build a Binary File with the Required Plugins Using the Base Binary File\\n\\nPlease view [Answer plugin docs](https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins/#binary-build).\\n```\\n# answer build --with [plugin@plugin_version=[replacement]] --output [file]\\n$ ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github\\n\\n# build a new answer with github login plugin then output to ./new_answer.\\n$ ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github@1.0.0 --output ./new_answer\\n\\n# with multiple plugins\\n$ ./answer build \\\\\\n--with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github \\\\\\n--with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-google\\n\\n# with local plugins\\n$ ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github@1.0.0=/my-local-space\\n\\n# cross compilation. Build a linux-amd64 binary in macos\\n$ CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github\\n\\n# specify the answer version using ANSWER_MODULE environment variable\\n$ ANSWER_MODULE=github.com/apache/incubator-answer@v1.2.0-RC1 ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github\\n```\\n\\nYou can choose the required plugins according to the instructions in the documentation. Compiling plugins will rebuild the front-end static resources. Plugins may have special dependencies, so dependency installation and compilation will be performed again here. After successful compilation, the `new_answer` binary file will be generated in the dist directory.\\n\\n\\nExample:\\n![new answer binary](new-answer.webp)\\n\\n#### 2.1.Build Single Plugin \\n\\n\\n`./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github`\\n\\nEffect:\\n![build progress](2.1.1.webp)\\n\\n![build progress](2.1.2.webp)\\n\\n![build progress](2.1.3.webp)\\n\\nVerify plugin installation command: `./new_answer plugin`.\\n\\n![confirm result](2.1.4.webp)\\n\\n\\n#### 2.2.Build Single Plugin Using Local Plugin Code \\n\\nIf you need to modify some plugin information or build a plugin using your own private implementation, you need to use the command `with local plugins`. For example, the `editor-formula` plugin mentioned above is compatible with Answer versions below 1.3.5, so you need to modify some plugin information. In this case, you can use the following command to build the plugin:\\n\\n`./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/editor-formula@0.0.3=/Users/shuai/answer/plugins/editor-formula`\\n\\nOutput:\\n![build progress](2.2.1.webp)\\n\\n![build progress](2.2.2.webp)\\n\\n![build progress](2.2.3.webp)\\n\\nVerify plugin installation command: `./new_answer plugin`.\\n\\n![confirm result](2.2.4.webp)\\n\\n\\n#### 2.3.Build Multiple Plugins  \\nThe process for building multiple plugins is similar to building a single plugin. Please kindly refer to building single plugin and try it yourself.\\n\\n### 3.Verify Plugins Locally   \\n\\nUsing the command line only ensures that the plugins have been installed. To check if the plugins are running correctly, you can run the generated binary file locally. Please refer to the [installation documentation](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation) for instructions on initializing the information. \\n![installation docs](installation.webp)\\n\\nPlease pay attention that you need to run the new_answer binary, so replace ./answer with ./new_answer in the command line.\\n\\n\\n### 4.Steps for Local Verification\\n\\n1. Initialization Complete    \\nFor example: `INSTALL_PORT=80 ./new_answer init -C ./answer-data`\\n\\n![local init](local-init.webp)\\n\\nAccess [http://localhost:80/install/](http://localhost:80/install/) and follow the [instructions](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation#install-steps) to complete the initialization process. \\n\\n2. Update Information     \\nRun the command  `./new_answer upgrade -C ./answer-data/` \\n\\n3.

From overwhelming during our first release, we are now out of the woods.\\n\\nSpeaking of releases, we can\u2019t neglect Release Manager. The person who makes sure that everything is compliant and everyone can access to the latest version. We talked to LinkinStars, the conductor behind each Apache Answer release. Let\'s see how he sees this role, how he handles obstacles, and his secrets to a smooth release.\\n\\n## Tell us a bit about yourself\\nI am the backend developer for Apache Answer. My daily routine includes developing the backend services of Answer, developing APIs, etc. I like coding, reading, and learning English. My tech stack is mainly Go, and my favorite open-source project is Kubernetes.\\n\\n## What makes you the release manager of Apache Answer, and what do you think of this role?\\nUsually, a backend engineer is responsible for the compilation, packaging, and deployment of the project. That\u2019s why I am here. \\n\\nThis role itself requires lots of patience and carefulness. Each package needs to be carefully checked to ensure that all the required files are correct and compliant. Release managers have a lot on their plate, since the releasing problems will lead to user upgrade or usage issues.\\n\\n## Can you briefly walk us through the release process? Which stages are more critical?\\nSure. The release process of Apache Answer consists of the following stages.\\n\\n![Release Process of Apache Answer](release-process.png)\\n\\nThe most important stage is actually the **preparation**. It involves preparation and review of all the content that needs to be released. We have to check and review the open-source requirements, license, signature, etc. If this stage is not well checked, we cannot pass the voting afterward.\\n\\n## Which tools/platforms do you use to release?\\nWe use GitHub Actions to build the packages and release.\\n\\n## What are the key factors for a successful release?\\nThe 2 key factors for a successful release are:\\n\\n**Check once, check twice, and check from the top again.**\\n**Test, test again, and another round of tests.**\\n\\nNo worries, as soon as you have released the first Apache version, things get easier and smoother. \\n\\n## How do you prioritize the tasks in the release process?\\nHandling multiple tasks happens occasionally, and here\u2019s how I manage them.\\n\\nOnce we decide to release the version, and there might still be new issues coming from the users. In this case, if there\u2019s no urgent bugs that need to be fixed, we will put them into the to-dos of the next version and move on. \\n\\n## How do you handle \\"unexpected events\\" during the release process?\\nSeek help from the mentors.        \\nI will ask them to locate the problem and help with the review. Then, we will fix it, and re-initiate the voting. \\n\\n## Can you share one of the most difficult challenges you faced during the release process, and how did you nail it?\\nThe most enduring challenge I faced was the first release. I had no idea about preparation, what to expect, and what\u2019s next. Here\u2019s how I manage to overcome the challenges with the team.\\n1. Collect and organize all the documents related to Apache releases.\\n2. Look into the release notes and emails of other Apache projects for reference.\\n3. Seek help from the mentors via emails.\\n\\nThe most important thing is to **keep trying**. The Apache community is friendly, and community members will remind you with assistance. Be brave, and embrace the mistakes. \\n\\n*Find out how we launched the first Apache Release [here](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/12/13/behind-the-scene-how-we-launched-the-first-apache-release).*\\n\\n## What are some strategies/tips you have for working effectively with your team during the release process?\\n1. Use GitHub issues and projects to manage all the released content, and then check one by one with each team member.\\n\\n2. Provide as much context as possible when describing an issue. This is particularly useful in email communication, as the more context leads to less misunderstanding and saves time.   \\n\\n## What do you find most rewarding about being a Release Manager?\\nIt\'s fulfilling to fix all the problems in a project after rounds of revisions, and a successful release. To receive feedback from the users is absolutely rewarding."},{"id":"/2024/02/20/answer-1.2.5-is-ready","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/02/20/answer-1.2.5-is-ready","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2024-02-20-answer-1.2.5-is-ready/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-20-answer-1.2.5-is-ready/index.md","title":"Answer 1.2.5 is Ready","description":"Answer supports dark mode and plugin notification.

Come to Answer.","permalink":"/blog/2024/01/25/first-contribution-come-to-answer"}},"content":"> I am already running Answer on my server, but I want to access it using HTTPS. How can I do that?\\n\\n## Background\\nWhen you already have a server, you may want to deploy Answer on it. After deploying Answer, you will realize that you can only access it using HTTP. However, you may want to access it using HTTPS. So how can you do that? \\n\\nSome questions:\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1G3/how-to-configure-ssl\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1wh/how-to-enable-ssl\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1XG2/how-to-deploy-answer-image-in-aws-in-docker-with-ssl-and-nginx\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D136/how-to-deploy-an-ssl-certificate-using-docker-and-how-to-access-it-without-using-a-port\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1Oe/i-have-set-up-ssl-on-cloudflare-but-still-can-t-access-via-https\\n- ...\\n\\nI found that many people have this question. Deploying Answer is easy, but deploying it with HTTPS is a bit difficult. So I decided to write this article to help you deploy Answer with HTTPS.\\n\\n## Easy way\\nThis blog aims to introduce the easiest way to deploy Answer with HTTPS. You can use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) to deploy Answer with HTTPS. Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go. Of course, you can use other tools to deploy Answer with HTTPS, such as Nginx, etc.\\n\\n## Preparation\\n1. You can follow the [installation guide](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation/) to install Answer. After installing Answer, you can access it using HTTP. The default port for Answer is 9080. You can access it at http://localhost:9080. In the following steps, we will use 9080 as the default port for Answer.\\n\\n2. You need a domain that **DNS resolution is already configured to point to your server**.\\n\\n3. In this blog we will use docker-compose to install Caddy. So we need docker and docker-compose. You can follow the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install docker and docker-compose.\\n\\n## Deploy \\n\\n### Step 1\\n```shell\\n$ mkdir caddy-docker\\n$ cd caddy-docker\\n$ vim docker-compose.yml\\n```\\nYou can create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the new directory, and then add the following code:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"docker-compose.yml\\"\\nversion: \\"3.7\\"\\n\\nservices:\\n  caddy:\\n    image: caddy\\n    restart: unless-stopped\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"80:80\\"\\n      - \\"443:443\\"\\n      - \\"443:443/udp\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile\\n      - $PWD/caddy_data:/data\\n      - $PWD/caddy_config:/config\\n    network_mode: host\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2\\nThe `Caddyfile` is the configuration file for Caddy. It is used to configure how Caddy should serve your site. This file will be mounted into the container at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ vim Caddyfile\\n```\\nCreate `Caddyfile` file in the same directory, and then add the following code:\\n\\n```text title=\\"Caddyfile\\"\\nyour.answer.domain {\\n    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9080\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3\\n\\nRun the following command to start Caddy. Wait a few seconds, and then you can access Answer using HTTPS.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ docker-compose up -d\\n```\\n\\nIf you can\'t access it, you can check the logs of Caddy.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ docker-compose logs\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced\\nIf you don\'t want to use `network_mode: host` in `docker-compose.yml`, you can put Answer and Caddy in the same docker compose. Then Caddy and Answer can use the same network. So you can configure Caddy like this:\\n\\n```text title=\\"Caddyfile\\"\\nyour.answer.domain {\\n    reverse_proxy answer-service:9080\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOf course, you can also install Caddy using other methods, such as using the binary file, etc. All in all, I wish you can follow this blog to deploy Answer with HTTPS successfully. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a question on [Meta](https://meta.answer.dev/). We will try our best to help you."},{"id":"/2024/01/25/first-contribution-come-to-answer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/01/25/first-contribution-come-to-answer","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2024-01-25-first-contribution-come-to-answer/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-25-first-contribution-come-to-answer/index.md","title":"First Contribution?

One Question.\\nAnswer focuses on clear and concise answers to each question. However, you can find new answers or scattered answers from one person in several responses, making it hard for the admin to pick the best answer, and maintain the content afterwards. \\n\\nWe\'ve streamlined things so everyone can write or edit one, top-notch answer to each question. This helps users focus on contributing their expertise, and lets the best answer shine.\\n\\n### How to\\nThis feature is on by default, and admin can switch it off anytime. \\n1.

Improvements.\\nSometimes, a small change can make a difference to your knowledge journey, and here they are. \\n\\n### Clearer Space for Comment and Answer\\nThe comment used to be blending in a bit before.

Now that we finally [shipped it](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/12/07/a-new-chapter-begins-answer-first-apache-release-launches), and look back to the lessons we\u2019ve learnt during the process. We\u2019ve been received help from other projects, so it\u2019s our chance to pave the way for more projects by sharing our experience. \\n\\nTo the future incubator projects: Consider this blog post your guide as you embark on your own first Apache release. Have a smooth release!\\n\\n## How Do We Collaborate\\nThe driving force behind this release are the 4 PMC members: [LinkinStars](https://github.com/LinkinStars), [shuashuai](https://github.com/shuashuai), [fenbox](https://github.com/fenbox), and [AnnaPrimma](https://github.com/PrimmaAnna), and here\u2019s how they collaborate:\\nfenbox: the architect, planing and crafting the new features.\\nLinkinStars: guardian of compliance, meticulous source code and binary package management.\\nshuashuai: front-end developer, fix bugs, iterate new features, keep flawless user experience, etc.\\nAnnaPrimma: the doc searcher, translator, and past project experience capturer.\\n\\n## New Changes\\nThere are basically two significant changes: **compliance and the voting process**, and we\u2019ve spent plenty of time on them. \\n\\n### Compliance\\nApache releases are required to comply with the Apache Software Foundation\'s (ASF) policies and procedures. One of the most important compliance requirements is that all **dependencies must also be compliant**.\\n\\nBefore we officially launch the release vote, we focused on compliance, as these are the basic requirements before the release. This includes:\\n\\n* Review and organize the Notice and LICENSE files\\n* Add the Apache License Header to all files\\n* Check the compliance of third-party libraries\\n\\nWe also checked on docs, seemed help from mentors via emails, and traced back to other project\u2019s releases. \\n\\n### Process \\nThe release process was extended because of the need of [Apache voting process](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html).\\n\\nThough not compulsory, it is recommended to have discussion in the community via mail list before voting. The first round of voting was conducted by the Project Management Committee (PMC), and the second round of voting was conducted by the Mentors. Voting periods should generally run for **at least 72 hours** to provide an opportunity for all concerned individuals to participate, regardless of their geographic location. A vote is considered successful if it receives at least three positive binding votes (+1).\\n\\n![Release Process](Release%20Process.png)\\n\\nWe were in a bit of a rush to close the voting when we received 3 votes of approval, and were told by another mentor. Please wait at least 72 hours after each round of voting before sending an email to announce the results and close the vote.\\n\\nBesides the release version number, don\u2019t forget to specify the commit ID of the last commit for the current version and the build node that was used to build the current version. \\n\\n## Things We Would Love to Share \\nHere are some takeaways from the release process. Hope it helps ;)\\n\\n### Email. Email. Email. \\nApache projects use mailing lists to coordinate development of their software and administer their organization. Mailing lists also serve as a primary support channel where users can help each other learn to use the software.\\n\\nWe spent a bit of time getting used to email communication, since we were used to instant communication tools. Email is a great way to reduce the information gap for current community members and new members. \\n\\n### Try First, Ask Later.\\nFor uncertain questions, try them first and then ask for your mentor\'s help if needed. Your mentors are here to guide and support, not to do all the work for you.\\n\\n### Be Patient and Seek Help from the Mentors\\nIf you\u2019ve tried but failed to find a solution, reach out to your mentor by email. \\nIn the initial phase of the release, one of the obstacles we faced was the format of the license. We first looked at some graduated projects, but turned out that each project had its format. Then, we decided to display the following information for each license: `(License Category) Packagename (Repository URL) [link](reference link)`. We sent an email for mentors\u2019 advice, and in the end we replaced the LICENSE application URL with the URL we have sorted out.\\n\\nIt finally looks like [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/main/docs/release/LICENSE). As you can see, classifying and organising licenses is something that takes a lot of patience.\\n\\n### Careful with the Assignment\\nIn the past, we simply assigned an issue to the person in charge. However, this approach is not community-driven today. Always remind yourself that: **Issues and pull requests should only be assigned to users who have volunteered to take them on**. \\n\\n\\n### Community Over Code\\nCommunity is the key to a project\'s success in graduating from Apache, and we\u2019re building our community. For an easy and smooth contribution experience, we collect everything a contributor needs on the [Community page](https://answer.apache.org/community/contributing), providing a central hub for information and simplifies the contribution process for everyone.\\n\\n## Recommended Docs for Release\\nhttps://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html        \\nhttps://linkis.apache.org/community/how-to-release/\\n\\nYou can always welcome to check our [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer) for reference.\\n\\n## Ready to shape the future of Q&A Software? \\nWe always have new ideas for Q&A, and plan to release a new version every month. You can find our upcoming plans and join the discussion on our [roadmap](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/projects?query=is%3Aopen). \\n\\nIf you\u2019re a Q&A enthusiast, a developer, or a multilingual speaker, we welcome your contributions, and there\u2019s always a way you can [get involved](https://answer.apache.org/community/contributing).

Can I still get a badge if my issues aren\'t accepted?\\n\\n It\u2019s hard to say this, but it\u2019s a No.\\n We appreciate your participation greatly. For various reasons, your suggested enhancement might not align with our roadmap or product direction as you may think. We recommend you start with a bug.

Why is Answer\'s plugin system designed in such a way that it seems a bit difficult to use?\\n> 2. How can I implement plugin functionality using Golang?\\n> 3. What exactly does Answer\'s plugin system do when it is compiled and packaged?\\n\\n## Background\\nYou can build a Q&A community using Answer easily. However, the basic features of Answer may not sufficiently support to every use case.\\nTherefore, we need to design a plugin system to extend its features.\\nAs you may know, Answer is built using `React.js` and `Golang`. Both these languages require compilation. So designing a plugin system is a bit difficult.\\n\\n## Goal & Features\\nThe goal of Answer\'s plugin system is to provide a **flexible** and **extendable** architecture that can accommodate a wide range of use cases. Some of the key features of the plugin system include:\\n\\n### Connectors\\nBy default, Answer supports login via email and password. Within the plugin system, developers can easily integrate other authentication, such as GitHub.\\n\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-connector.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n### Storage\\nOut of the box, Answer stores files in the local file system. However, there could be scenarios where users might prefer to save their uploaded files to a cloud storage service like `S3`. This can be achieved by the plugin system.\\n\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-storage.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n## Implementation\\nNow, let\'s explore how the plugin system is implemented, followed by the reasons behind our design decisions.\\n\\n### Details\\nThe general process is as follows:\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-build-brief.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in implementing a plugin:\\n\\n1. Generate a `main.go` file.\\n2. Import the specific plugin list.\\n3. Execute `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` to manage dependencies.\\n4. Copy the UI directory.\\n5. Overwrite the `index.ts` file.\\n6. Execute `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to manage the package and build the project.\\n7. Merge the `i18n` file from the plugin with the original `i18n` file.\\n8. Build a new binary.\\n9. Clean up the byproducts generated during the build process.\\n\\n![answer-plugin-build-all.png](answer-plugin-build-all.png)\\n\\n### Reason\\nHere are the reasons behind our design choices:\\n\\n#### Static Compilation\\n> This is the main reason why the plugin system is designed this way.\\n\\n`React.js` and `Golang` both these languages require compilation. They are not dynamically executable like some other scripting languages.\\nSo the plugin system should be a static compilation, which means that the application and plugins are compiled together, resulting in a single binary that can be easily distributed and deployed.\\n\\n#### Fixed Functionality\\nThe plugin system allows users to add features that are fixed for their specific use cases without changing the core system.\\nFurthermore, these functionalities persistently remain operational once they are employed. \\nTherefore, it is sufficient to deliberate on the necessities of their incorporation at the initial stage, and subsequently, package them accordingly.\\nIn the future, we can build a Docker image that contains all official plugins, thereby enabling users to access the entire range of features. The enablement or disablement of these functionalities can be managed through the plugin control interface.\\n\\n#### Extension\\nThe most important capability of a plugin system is its extensibility.\\nA program can\'t provide all the functions that every user wants. \\nHowever, with a plugin system, users can develop their plugins to help them achieve the functions that they want.\\n\\n## Reference\\nThe Caddy is a great open-source software that inspired the design of the Answer plugin system.\\nCaddy is a web server that allows developers to extend its functionality using plugins. \\nUsing [xcaddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/) can easy to make custom builds of the Caddy Web Server. \\n \\n## More\\nIn this blog post, we discussed the design and implementation of the plugin system for Answer, a popular open-source Q&A platform. \\nWe discussed the motivation behind the design, and the features and principles of the plugin system, and provided a step-by-step guide on implementation. \\nIf you are interested in developing plugins for Answer, please feel free to leave us a comment. \\nWe will also write an article on how to implement an Answer plugin from scratch, so stay focused!"},{"id":"/2023/07/19/how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/19/how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2023-07-19-how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-19-how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community/index.md","title":"How to Utilize Reputation and Privilege in Online Community","description":"Meet Answer\u2019s reputation and privilege systems and automate them for efficient community content management.

Trust Building\\n\\nA positive reputation indicates credibility, reliability, and expertise.

Moderation and Governance\\n\\nAfter activation in Answer, community members will gain 1 reputation score, and are allowed to participate in general activities in the community, such as asking questions, writing answers, upvote comment, etc. Reputation scores are also used by community moderators and administrators to determine user [privileges](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/permission), such as posting more than 2 links at a time, creating a new tag, etc.\\n\\n![Add a New Tag in Answer](AddaNewTag.png)\\n\\nIn Answer, you\u2019ll need 125 reputation scores to downvote, while downvote someone\u2019s answer will reduce one reputation score. This prevents malicious downvoting and boosts answers through intentional others\u2019 answers. This helps maintain a healthy community environment and discourage disruptive behavior.\\n\\nThe scale of communities is different, so is the reputation system. We\u2019ve prepared 3 different privilege levels for teams at different scales.\\n\\n![Levels of Privileges in Answer](LevelsofPrivileges.png)\\n\\n### 4. Community Engagement\\n\\nThe reputation system allows community members to actively engage in the community. They can share expertise, contribute to discussions, and vote for better answers, fostering a positive and collaborative environment.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nReputation in an online community is a reflection of a user\u2019s contributions, engagement, and commitment to the community.

Effective knowledge sharing increases productivity, and enhances collaboration within your team.\\n\\nAnswer was inspired by the inherent openness of Q&A platforms and communities. As the team behind Answer, we appreciate and embody the spirit of knowledge sharing when tuning Answer.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will explore types of knowledge, ways of knowledge sharing, and strategies to improve knowledge sharing for your team with Answer.\\n\\n## What is Knowledge Sharing?\\n\\n[![Knowledge Sharing](knowledgesharing1.jpeg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/140596819595429978/)\\n\\n[Knowledge Sharing\xa0Comic by Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing)is an activity through which knowledge (namely, information, skills, or expertise) is exchanged among people, friends, peers, families, communities, or within or between organizations.\\n\\nAnswer is a platform for knowledge sharing, and the form of asking and answering is a natural way of knowledge sharing. The information in Answer can be documented for every user to check. Admins can modify them for keeping them up-to-date.\\n\\n## 3 Types and Ways of Knowledge Sharing\\n\\n01. Explicit Knowledge\\n Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.\\n Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence.\\n   ![Explicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing2.png)\\n\\n02. Implicit Knowledge\\n The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and \\"know-how\\" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices.\\n Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.\\n    ![Implicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing3.png)\\n\\n03. Tacit Knowledge\\n Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.\\n Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship.\\n   ![Tacit Knowledge](knowledgesharing4.png)\\n\\n## Effective Knowledge Sharing with Answer\\n\\nNo matter which type of knowledge your company or team has, it never goes wrong to capture, store and share them effectively for everyone on the team.\\n\\nEffective knowledge sharing involves sharing information, expertise, and insights. It requires creating a culture that values collaboration and providing tools for easy exchange of knowledge. Here\u2019s how Answer helps for effective knowledge sharing.\\n\\n1. Open and Collaborative Culture\\n Encourage and value knowledge sharing for everyone on the team. The essence of Answer is open source, and the Q&A platform itself is open and collaborative.\\n In Answer, you can customize the layout and add rules in the sidebar to remind everyone subtly.\\n ![Customize Right Sidebar](knowledgesharing5.png)\\n You can also pin the welcome post that includes regulations, values, and spirit of your platform, ensuring new members can see the post as soon as they join your community, while helping community members to check.\\n ![Alt text](knowledgesharing6.png)\\n  \\n2. Make Knowledge Accessible\\n In Answer, sharing and accessing to knowledge is like breathing. Everyone is a loop of knowledge sharing: add a question, provide answer, upvote, etc. This fosters a collaborative spirit for the community naturally.\\n ![Answer a Question](knowledgesharing7.png)\\n\\n Admin can also add wikis, FAQ for users in the sidebar to provide relevant knowledge.\\n ![Customize Left Sidebar](knowledgesharing8.png)\\n\\n3. Effective Knowledge Management  \\n Besides knowledge storage, and creation, knowledge management is the key that keeps your platform running. In Answer, you can manage different types of knowledge by tags. You can find tags are like troops, guarding each question so that you can identify the category you need immediately.\\n ![Tags with Post](knowledgesharing9.png)\\n Managing tags is also easy. Admins can add, edit or remove a tag in one place.\\n ![Manage Tags](knowledgesharing10.png)\\n4. Recognition and Rewards\\n Express gratitude to the contributors and experts.\\n In Answer, we\u2019ve automated the [reputation system](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation), encouraging ownership and motivation to share valuable insights. Users can earn reputation scores by asking questions that everyone concerns, receiving votes from other users, answers accepted. It\u2019s a reflection of how active you are in the community. With more reputation scores, you\u2019ll unlock more features, such as upvote, invite an answer, edit other\u2019s question, etc.\\n\\n5. Feedback and Evaluation  \\n Encouraging feedback loops and continuous improvement for your community. Once you\'ve obtained a sufficient reputation score, you can start voting for questions or answers, providing feedback to enhance its quality and relevance.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUnderstand three types of knowledge and find an effective way to share in the team. Answer is always here to help. Discover a new era of knowledge sharing with Answer, and there are more features waiting for you.
