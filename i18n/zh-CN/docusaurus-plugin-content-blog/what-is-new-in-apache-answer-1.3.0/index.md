We know we all have different habits to browse, navigate, and manage your online community, support center, or knowledge base. We built Apache Answer to stay out of your way, so you can focus and do everything in the way you want, with features and interactions that are just right.

In [Answer 1.3.0](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/releases/tag/v1.3.0), we’re moving forward to make review and navigation better for you. Here are the features, new improves, and gratitude to all the contributors. [Upgrade](https://answer.apache.org/docs/upgrade) now and enjoy the reading today.

## What’s New
### Review in One Place
Let the review happened in the place. Now admins and moderators can review flagged content in Review, which is in the sidebar on the left.

There are ways different actions provided in **Approve**, including edit post, close, delete, and enlist post.

Besides, we also provide filters to make the reviewing process efficient. With just a click, you can check the specific content waiting in queue. 

### Build Your Review Plugin from Today
We add an example review plugin to check user’s first post before it officially goes online. This ensures high-quality content in your community, while every user understands the posting rules.

You can build your review plugin for unpublished posts based on your review process based on this example plugin. Click [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/reviewer-basic) to know more about this plugin. 

### Sort Answer from Oldest to Newest
Observing how an answer develops until the current version can bring clarity. Now there’s no need to scroll to the bottom for earlier answers, simply click the Oldest.
