You have to admit that, your customers always have and will ask questions even if your product is perfect. Obviously, not every question needs a team to solve, which makes self-service effective (a support team is still needed). That’s what help center comes for: provide the right information, in a right approach, at the right time for your customers.

In today’s blog, we will build a help center from the scratch with a bit of community sprit in Answer.

## What’s a Help Center

A Help Center serves as a valuable resource for users. It provides customers immediate help by helping them find answers and resolve issues independently.

When building a help center, here are 2 common questions you need to address:  

**What types of answers or help do users require?**
**How can they always get the answers they require?**
**How can I maintain and run help center efficiently?**

No worries, we will resolve these problems one by one and build a help center from the scratch together in the coming part of this blog.

## Why Answer for a Help Center?

Here’s how a traditional help center works: users come and seek answers, administrators provide answers constantly, and everything goes over again.

As the content in the help center becomes abundant, things change. For users, finding the correct answer can be challenging. Similarly, administrators face the pressure of maintaining, and running an effective help center.

However, in Answer, everything is entirely different from traditional help center.
In Answer, **everyone can ask and respond**, creating a mutual way interaction. Every user can ask a question, contribute, vote for an answer, etc. Here, the user is no longer waiting for answers passively, but becomes a part of help center management. This also alleviates the pressure of administrators, allowing them to focus on the roadmap of the help center.

## Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)

The essence of a help center is to provide the right answer to the problems occurring already, and Answer is born for this. Here’s how, and you’ll know why.

### 01. Start with the FAQs

### 02. Make Content Consistent

In Answer, help center is not just about self-service, but also about helping each other. Customers can also write answers to others, then admin and moderator will read and accept the best answers. If the question is answered perfectly in content, but not consistent with your style guide, you can have an admin or moderator to tune and make it looks shining again.

### 04. Keep the Answers Fresh and Ready

Don’t make your help center end up with outdated answers. Though users are actively becoming a part of the community, moderators still need regular review and edit. Keep an eye on product launch, tweaks and updates, and you’ll notice how effective tags can be when updating the content.

When updating or editing a post, use [Unlist](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/05/11/answer-1.0.9-release#whats-new) to hide the post temporarily to avoid misunderstanding.
