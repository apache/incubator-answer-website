Another page turns, and it was a busy month with some petit milestones. We made a new release, unlock a new event, and headed to a big gathering with the community.
Here's the recap:

## 🌟 What's New
New version released on the beginning of a month. In this update, both users and admins have more freedom to customize, express, and view in the online community with new features. Have you tried the latest 1.3.5? If not, here's the [portal](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fanswer.apache.org%2Fdownload).

We made a debut at GitHub Open Source Spotlight at WeAreDevelopers World Congress in Berlin. It was lovely to meet other open-source friends, and guess what, we met some of our users!

Big thanks to GitHub for letting us make a big footstep and share our story to more developers.

As an Apache incubating podling, how can we miss the community gathering? Yes, we also joined CommunityOverCode Asia 2024

It was a lovely 3-day event! We made our several firsts — Keynote and speeches at 2 tracks. We were lucky to be nourished by the community, and we wanted to give back by sharing our lessons and story during first Apache release and spread the ideas of various contributions.
