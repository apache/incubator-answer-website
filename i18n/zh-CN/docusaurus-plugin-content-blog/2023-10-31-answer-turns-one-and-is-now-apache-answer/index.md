We couldn’t believe it, but let’s face it: October (it’s October 24th, to be more specific) marks our first anniversary!

We launched Answer Alpha in last October, and made it to GitHub Trending. Our first stable version, Answer v1.0 was released in last December. This October, we passed the vote and became an [Apache Incubator Project](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/answer.html). It feels like yesterday we were sharing the news! 

For the past year, we’ve released 19 versions, and formed a compact but powerful community. Here are some features, numbers, and people that we are proud to share with all of you:
* Worked with 37 contributors and 59 volunteers
* 221 pull requests
* Translated in 15 languages
* Over 10,000 downloads
* Our [First Hacktoverfest](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/09/27/celebrate-answer-first-anniversary-with-hacktoberfest-2023)
* [Documentation](https://answer.apache.org/docs) for everyone to install, learn how-tos, contribute, etc. (tell/help us improve!)
* Reputation and privileges rules for teams at different scales
* Plugin support 
* SEO friendly: schema, canonical, SEO friendly URLs, robots.txt and auto meta tags
* Private mode is on for team’s privacy
* Real-time preview for adding a new question
* Auto save
* Pin and hide
* Tags: quick adding, efficient content management, searching
* Customize community identity, sidebar, etc. 
* Anti-spam rules
* Add users in bulk
* Email notification for new questions

Behind the GitHub stars, we are honored to be the companion to help more teams unleash collective wisdom.

## [Apache Answer](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/answer.html) is Proudly Incubated Apache Incubator
We realized that a long-term healthy community is important for an open-source project, and becoming an [Apache project](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/10/24/answer-enters-apache-incubator/) will guide us there. Nurtured in the Apache Way, we will build a fair, diverse and inclusive community, while ship great features with the community. 


## Big Thanks and Big Hugs
We are truly thankful to contributors and volunteers for their time and effort spent with us to make Apache Answer a better place for questions, answers, discussions, etc. 

Working with the community that consists of a group of product users, lovers, and helpers is wonderful, we cannot tell how amazing it is. Gear up, here comes a new episode.
