Flag is not merely a way to report inappropriate content to the community, but a smart and effective way to maintain a respectful environment with collective responsibility.

## Reputation: Contribution and Recognition

The reputation system incentivizes users to participate and contribute to collective knowledge. In Answer, the reputation score is right next to the user’s name, which is a badge of presenting one’s credibility, reliability, and expertise.

Most of the reputation is related to positive action or content, such as your question or answer is upvoted, your answer is accepted, or you accept someone’s answer, etc.

## Permission: Customizing Content Engagement

With more reputation scores, community members gain both recognition and **privileges** to participate in content management of the community. In Answer, we have [3 privileges systems](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/permission) for communities at different scales. For example, a community member wants to upvote a question, it takes different reputation scores. For a private team, it requires 1 reputation score, while in a startup community, it requires 8.

Admin can always change the privileges level in Admin settings based on current community status.

This personalized approach encourages diverse engagement levels, ensures both newcomers and experienced contributors with the right permissions. It fosters an inclusive atmosphere where everyone's voice is valued.

## Moderation: Collaboration and Safeguard

Trusted members are a part of the content management loop, ensuring content quality and adherence to guidelines. Though Answer grants active users who stick to the community rules the authority to manage and oversee content within the community, admins still needs to review edits from users with less reputation scores.
