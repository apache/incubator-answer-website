## About Apache Incubator [1]

![Apache Incubator](apache-incubator-logo.png)

Created in 2002, the Apache Incubator provides services to projects which want to enter the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It helps those incoming projects (called "podlings") adopt the Apache style of governance and operation and guides them to the ASF services available to our projects, so they can become top-level ASF projects ("TLPs").

The Incubator delegates a few mentors for each podling to act as liaisons with the various ASF teams: Incubator PMC, Infrastructure team, etc., and facilitate the podling’s growth and operations.

Answer will embrace the Apache way with the guidance of the 4 Incubator Mentors:
- Willem Jiang, Director of the Apache Software Foundation and Incubator Mentor.
- tison, Member of the Apache Software Foundation and Incubator Mentor.
- Justin Mclean, Apache Software Foundation VP, and Board Member.
- Christofer Dutz, Board Member of the Apache Software Foundation and Incubator Mentor.

## Acknowledgement
Joining Apache Incubator is a significant milestone of Answer and marks new challenges and beginnings. We would love to express our profound gratitude to our Champion Willem Jiang, as well as our mentors tison, Justin Mclean, and Christofer Dutz, for their support and encouragement during the proposal. 

We would also love to give a big applause and thank you to contributors and volunteers around the world for the contributions and support.
