## How to Contribute

## Creating an Issue
- Feel free to ask your questions if you have any.

## Creating a Pull Request
- We appreciate you taking the time to contribute! Before submitting a pull request, we ask that you please create an issue that explains the bug or feature request and let us know that you plan on creating a pull request for it. If an issue already exists, please comment on that issue letting us know you would like to submit a pull request for it. This helps us to keep track of the pull request and make sure there isn't duplicated effort.

## Commit Message Guidelines
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

### type
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### scope
The scope can be anything specifying place of the commit change.

### subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- do not capitalize first letter
- do not place a period . at the end
- entire length of the commit message must not go over 50 characters
- describe what the commit does, not what issue it relates to or fixes
- be brief, yet descriptive - we should have a good understanding of what the commit does by reading the subject
