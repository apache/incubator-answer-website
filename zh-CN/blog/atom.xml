<!-- --><li>
<!-- --><p>You can follow the <!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installation guide</a> to install Answer.

In the following steps, we will use 9080 as the default port for Answer.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>
<!-- --><p>You need a domain that <!-- --><strong>DNS resolution is already configured to point to your server</strong>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --></li>

<!-- --><p>In this blog we will use docker-compose to install Caddy. So we need docker and docker-compose. You can follow the <!-- --><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official guide</a> to install docker and docker-compose.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>There are basically two significant changes: <!-- --><strong>compliance and the voting process</strong>, and we’ve spent plenty of time on them.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>Apache releases are required to comply with the Apache Software Foundation's (ASF) policies and procedures. One of the most important compliance requirements is that all <!-- --><strong>dependencies must also be compliant</strong>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Before we officially launch the release vote, we focused on compliance, as these are the basic requirements before the release. This includes:</p>
<!-- --><ul>
<!-- --><li>Review and organize the Notice and LICENSE files</li>
<!-- --><li>Add the Apache License Header to all files</li>
<!-- --><li>Check the compliance of third-party libraries</li>
<!-- --></ul>
<!-- --><p>We also checked on docs, seemed help from mentors via emails, and traced back to other project’s releases.</p>
<!-- --><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_pwhL" id="process">Process<!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/zh-CN/blog/2023/12/13/behind-the-scene-how-we-launched-the-first-apache-release#process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Process的直接链接" title="Process的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<!-- --><p>The release process was extended because of the need of <!-- --><a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache voting process</a>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Though not compulsory, it is recommended to have discussion in the community via mail list before voting. The first round of voting was conducted by the Project Management Committee (PMC), and the second round of voting was conducted by the Mentors. Voting periods should generally run for <!-- --><strong>at least 72 hours</strong> to provide an opportunity for all concerned individuals to participate, regardless of their geographic location. A vote is considered successful if it receives at least three positive binding votes (+1).<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Release Process" src="https://answer.apache.org/zh-CN/assets/images/Release%20Process-379e543f928935865c77847680c8c91a.png" width="917" height="1037" class="img_WevL"></p>
<!-- --><p>We were in a bit of a rush to close the voting when we received 3 votes of approval, and were told by another mentor. Please wait at least 72 hours after each round of voting before sending an email to announce the results and close the vote.</p>
<!-- --><p>Besides the release version number, don’t forget to specify the commit ID of the last commit for the current version and the build node that was used to build the current version.</p>

<!-- --><p>If you’ve tried but failed to find a solution, reach out to your mentor by email.
In the initial phase of the release, one of the obstacles we faced was the format of the license. We first looked at some graduated projects, but turned out that each project had its format. Then, we decided to display the following information for each license: <!-- --><code>(License Category) Packagename (Repository URL) [link](reference link)</code>. We sent an email for mentors’ advice, and in the end we replaced the LICENSE application URL with the URL we have sorted out.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>It finally looks like <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/main/docs/release/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>. As you can see, classifying and organising licenses is something that takes a lot of patience.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>You can build a Q&amp;A community using Answer easily. However, the basic features of Answer may not sufficiently support to every use case.

<!-- --><p>Here are the reasons behind our design choices:</p>

<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p>This is the main reason why the plugin system is designed this way.</p>
<!-- --></blockquote>
<!-- --><p><code>React.js</code> and <!-- --><code>Golang</code> both these languages require compilation. They are not dynamically executable like some other scripting languages.
So the plugin system should be a static compilation, which means that the application and plugins are compiled together, resulting in a single binary that can be easily distributed and deployed.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_pwhL" id="fixed-functionality">Fixed Functionality<!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/zh-CN/blog/2023/07/22/why-the-answer-plugin-system-was-designed-this-way#fixed-functionality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Fixed Functionality的直接链接" title="Fixed Functionality的直接链接">​</a></h4>
<!-- --><p>The plugin system allows users to add features that are fixed for their specific use cases without changing the core system.
Furthermore, these functionalities persistently remain operational once they are employed.
Therefore, it is sufficient to deliberate on the necessities of their incorporation at the initial stage, and subsequently, package them accordingly.
In the future, we can build a Docker image that contains all official plugins, thereby enabling users to access the entire range of features. The enablement or disablement of these functionalities can be managed through the plugin control interface.</p>

<!-- --><p>The most important capability of a plugin system is its extensibility.
A program can't provide all the functions that every user wants.
However, with a plugin system, users can develop their plugins to help them achieve the functions that they want.</p>

<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li>
<!-- --><p>Explicit Knowledge
Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.
Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence.
<!-- --><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Explicit Knowledge" src="https://answer.apache.org/zh-CN/assets/images/knowledgesharing2-e27974416464f2797af6ef06168fa37f.png" width="800" height="794" class="img_WevL"></p>
<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>
<!-- --><p>Implicit Knowledge
The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and "know-how" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices.
Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.
<!-- --><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Implicit Knowledge" src="https://answer.apache.org/zh-CN/assets/images/knowledgesharing3-8f63717e99f63fedc360f881aec86063.png" width="800" height="794" class="img_WevL"></p>
<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>
<!-- --><p>Tacit Knowledge
Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.
Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship.
<!-- --><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Tacit Knowledge" src="https://answer.apache.org/zh-CN/assets/images/knowledgesharing4-5da1e97fe917bf9b3319fb12198e9026.png" width="800" height="794" class="img_WevL"></p>

<!-- --><p>No matter which type of knowledge your company or team has, it never goes wrong to capture, store and share them effectively for everyone on the team.</p>
<!-- --><p>Effective knowledge sharing involves sharing information, expertise, and insights. It requires creating a culture that values collaboration and providing tools for easy exchange of knowledge. Here’s how Answer helps for effective knowledge sharing.</p>
<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li>
<!-- --><p>Open and Collaborative Culture
Encourage and value knowledge sharing for everyone on the team. The essence of Answer is open source, and the Q&amp;A platform itself is open and collaborative.
In Answer, you can customize the layout and add rules in the sidebar to remind everyone subtly.

You can also pin the welcome post that includes regulations, values, and spirit of your platform, ensuring new members can see the post as soon as they join your community, while helping community members to check.

<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>
<!-- --><p>Make Knowledge Accessible
In Answer, sharing and accessing to knowledge is like breathing. Everyone is a loop of knowledge sharing: add a question, provide answer, upvote, etc. This fosters a collaborative spirit for the community naturally.

<!-- --><p>Effective Knowledge Management<!-- --><br>
