At Answer, we are longing to give back to the community. The essence of Answer is open source, and everyone can access it since the first day we launched Answer on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer). This October marks Answer’s first anniversary, and there’s no way better than celebrating with open-source enthusiasts.

October also marks the 10th anniversary of Hacktoberfest, an annual month-long event that encourages open-source software contributions. Founded in 2014, Hacktoberfest encourages participants to make contributions and support open-source projects they love on GitHub. These contributions include coding, low code, and non-code contributions, encouraging more individuals to collaborate and be a part of the open-source community.

### Vaunt Your Contribution

We are partnering with [Vaunt](https://github.com/VauntDev) during Hacktoberfest to reward contributions. Our team will have an initial review of the submitted issues, and tag it with **hacktoberfest-accepted** first. Then, we will have a closer look to see whether it shares the same goals or visions with our[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/answerdev/projects/1). If it’s a yes, we will add **LGTM** tag to it, and congratulations you’ll get a digital badge from us! Here's a group photo of all the badges, from top to bottom and left to right, in order: Plugin Maestro, Bug Hunter, and Visionary Architect. Earn it and show them with pride.

## Resources and FAQ

Here's the gear you need before making a contribution, and we are always here to help ;)

* Docs: <https://answer.apache.org/docs/>
* Community: <https://meta.answer.dev/>
* <dev@answer.apache.org>

1. How to show my digital badges on my GitHub?

 Please use the following code to show your attained swag.
 ```html
   <p>
      <img src="https://api.vaunt.dev/v1/github/entities/{{github_username}}/achievements?format=svg&limit=3" width="350" />
    </p>
 ```

2. Why hasn't my badge appeared yet?

 The vaunt data pulls took place before the two issues were created. This results in at most a 24-hour delay in when the achievement will be awarded. Achievements would have shown up automatically in the next data pull without any intervention, but Vaunt went ahead and re-ran the data pull operations on our end to trigger the achievement grants.

3. Can I still get a badge if my issues aren't accepted?

 It’s hard to say this, but it’s a No.
 We appreciate your participation greatly. For various reasons, your suggested enhancement might not align with our roadmap or product direction as you may think. We recommend you start with a bug. A bug is a bug, and this will increase your chances of earning a badge.
