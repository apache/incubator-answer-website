As the days grow shorter and the nights cooler, here comes the newsletter of August. Time to recap the new release, fresh features, and give big hugs to the contributors.

Let's go!

## 🌟 What’s New

We brought the heart of bringing smoother Q&A experience in every release for more people. In the latest 1.3.6, we introduced two CDN plugins for fast loading speed and pre-filled forms for helping users to stay concentrated on editing the content. 
Learn more about the details and how-to tutorials in the blog as well as optimizations carried in the release.

### New Tutorial: Setup and Plugin

Besides new features, we also received three new blogs from the community, covering configuration and plugin tutorial. 

We understand that it can be challenging for developers to set up the environment with [Developer Guides](https://answer.apache.org/docs/development). Now, it gets easier, simply following the blogs with step-to-step configuration and installation guide for both frontend and backend.
