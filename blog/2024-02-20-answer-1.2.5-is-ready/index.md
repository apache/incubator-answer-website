## Exciting New Changes
As we embrace the new season, we also prepare some enhancements to existing features. Here’s a sneak peek for better knowledge sharing.

### Easier Invitation. Better Sharing.
The interface and interaction of invitation is refreshed. You can check invited users while add community member at the same time.

### Customize the Reputation Score
There’s no one-size-fits-all rule, and it’s true when it comes to the community. You can familiarize with the reputation system first with default levels, and use custom level to fit your platform. Now, admins can customize the reputation score to keep the community engaged.

### Tags. No Clutter.
Small tags are powerful. It’s the thread of the community, sewing similar content together for the users, while providing a neat garment for the admin. We make slight changes to make tags adding and searching fresh.
