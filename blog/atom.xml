<!-- --><p>Becoming a PPMC member of the Apache Answer incubator project means so much to me. It is more than a milestone, but a valuable open-source journey watching Answer grow from small project to a thriving community.</p>
<!-- --><p>I actually had a chance to join the SegmentFault team before Answer was even open-sourced, but things didn't work out. Looking back, I kind of kicked myself for missing out on this opportunity!</p>
<!-- --><p>On October 24th 2022, Answer was launched and open sourced. When I saw that news, I jumped right in and checked on the repo. Then, I submitted my first <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/pull/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR</a>: <!-- --><code>doc: update install</code>. Answer is built with Go and Node.js while I’m a more of a PHP person, so I was swaying away from it.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>The following year, Answer passed the vote and joined the ASF incubator. My second <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/pull/577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR</a>: <!-- --><code>fix: typo</code> was submitted by that time.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>The WeChat group of SegmentFault was buzzing with congrats, while a question arose: 'When can I get my own @apache.org email?' I muted the chat and got back to work but couldn’t help thinking about that question.</p>

<!-- --><p>The Apache Incubator was started in 2002 to help projects get ready to become part of the ASF. The ASF is huge—it's the world's largest open-source foundation with thousands of contributors working on hundreds of projects. From web servers and big data to storage and machine learning, Apache software is everywhere. And it's all free to use!</p>
<!-- --><p>Each project in the incubator will be assigned with a few mentors who help guide them as they grow and become fully-fledged ASF projects. Once a project has met all the requirements, it can graduate and become a top-level project (TLP).</p>
<!-- --><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ArXL" id="the-apache-way">The Apache Way<!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/blog/lufei-asf-journey-from-contributor-to-ppmc-member#the-apache-way" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Apache Way" title="Direct link to The Apache Way">​</a></h3>
<!-- --><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Apache Way" src="https://answer.apache.org/assets/images/Apache%20Way-8573b78ae655711d0efac62e252baa48.PNG" width="1280" height="430" class="img_RAU7">
The "Apache Way" is a core philosophy of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) that outlines a set of community governance principles for open-source projects. It emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and community-driven project management, ensuring that projects aren't controlled by a select few but are driven forward by a group of contributors. Here are some key principles of the "Apache Way":<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li>Community-Driven Development: Projects are driven by the community, not individuals or companies.</li>
<!-- --><li>Transparency: All discussions and decisions are open to everyone. It is typically done through mailing lists or public discussion platforms.</li>
<!-- --><li>Consensus-Based Decision Making: Important decisions are made through consensus. This minuses confrontational disagreements while ensuring that most of the community supports key changes to the project.</li>
<!-- --><li>Respect and Inclusion: A welcoming environment for all contributors.</li>
<!-- --><li>Contributor-driven: Everyone has the opportunity to take on greater responsibilities through contributions. The progression from Contributor to Committer to PMC Member (Project Management Committee) is based on contributions and community trust.</li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --><p>By following these principles, Apache projects foster collaboration, innovation, and long-term sustainability.</p>
<!-- --><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ArXL" id="becoming-a-committer">Becoming a Committer<!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/blog/lufei-asf-journey-from-contributor-to-ppmc-member#becoming-a-committer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Becoming a Committer" title="Direct link to Becoming a Committer">​</a></h2>
<!-- --><p>I was hooked on Apache Answer because of its tech stack. As a developer eager to learn Go, this was the perfect opportunity to put my skills into practice. I started with <!-- --><code>good first issue</code> which was a great way to get my feet wet. I started with some simple tasks, like fixing typos and adding small features.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>The community was incredibly supportive, and with their guidance, I gradually gained a deeper understanding of the project's architecture. As my Go skills improved, so did my contributions. I was thrilled when I was invited to become a Committer in June 2024. After signing the ICLA, I couldn't wait to have my Apache account!</p>

<!-- --><p>On June 27, 2024, I received the email: Welcome to the Apache Software Foundation, and it was the time to unlock my ASF committer account.</p>

<!-- --><p>Just a week later, on July 8th, I was added to the Apache Answer Committer list. Becoming a Committer is more than an identity, but taking on more responsibilities, including code reviews, quality checks, and helping new contributors.</p>

<!-- --><p>Becoming a Committer made me even more invested in Apache Answer.

<!-- --><p>Being nominated for PPMC was both exciting and humbling. As a PPMC member, I’ll be working closely with the community to guide the project's direction, ensure we're following the Apache Way, and attract more developers. It's a big responsibility, but I'm thrilled to be a part of it.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="mb-4"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://answer.apache.org/assets/images/2024-11-13-cover@4x-5ed46e1fb9f11642745527330d10c454.png" class="rounded img_RAU7" width="1280px" height="720px"></div><p>An Apache release follows a rigorous process with valid, signed, artifacts, voted on by the appropriate PMC and ultimately distributed on the official ASF release infrastructure. Each project designates a committer to be release manager for release preparation, execution, and document maintenance, etc. Apache encourages committers to take turns in this role for different release, ensuring release quality, efficiency, and process optimization.</p>
<!-- --><p>Since joining the Apache Incubator in October 2023, Apache Answer has released 8 Apache versions with 4 release managers involved. With their help, the project has accumulated Apache release experience. The process of merging code and packaging has become smoother, the Release doc includes more details, and the recent added email templates make writing voting emails easier.</p>
<!-- --><p>In today's read, we will look back at the challenges encountered by the release managers during the release, how they solved them, and how they improved the release documentation and the release process.</p>
<!-- --><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ArXL" id="evolution-of-the-release-doc">Evolution of the Release Doc<!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/blog/how-release-managers-make-the-release-process-productive#evolution-of-the-release-doc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evolution of the Release Doc" title="Direct link to Evolution of the Release Doc">​</a></h2>
<!-- --><p>As the foundation of the release, the release doc provides detailed guidance. It also serves as a testament to the project’s maturity and independence in release management.</p>
<!-- --><p>LinkinStars, a backend engineer, became Apache Answer’s <!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/blog/meet-our-release-manager-linkinstars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first release manager</a>. He crafted the initial version of the release doc with an entire release cycle and final deployment. In this version, the release doc packed with process from packaging, signing, verification, and uploading, as well as email templates. With his help, Apache Answer’s <!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/zh-CN/blog/a-new-chapter-begins-answer-first-apache-release-launches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first Apache release</a> was successfully launched on November 29th, 2023.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Later on, the PPMC members started to take turns following the guidance of the mentor. By rotating this role, the community was not only familiarized with the release process but also able to identify the optimization gap.</p>
<!-- --><p>As the frontend developer of Apache Answer, shuai built Apache Answer’s frontend from scratch. He took up the torch and became the second release manager. During the release process, he enhanced the doc by elaborating of GPG keys, methods of file verification, and ways to obtain email links.</p>

<!-- --><p>Kumfo has taken over from shuai as the third release manager for Apache Answer. As a backend developer, he contributed to the development of features related to reputation, upvoting, and other event-driven functionalities. He made modifications and additions based on feedback from IPMC Members.</p>

<!-- --><p>For LinkinStars, the first release was undoubtedly a huge challenge. He first worked with other PPMC members to collect and organize the relevant release documentation, creating an initial release process.</p>
<!-- --><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="https://answer.apache.org/assets/images/release-process-375f70416d091b9a8bff07ef6a1ae600.PNG" width="917" height="1037" class="img_RAU7"></p>

<!-- --><p>After shuai‘s take-over, he referred to LinkinStars’ release documentation and prepared the GPG key and SVN configuration in advance. However, he still faced issues such as incorrect email subject/content, missing content after packaging, and incorrect signatures. To avoid formatting errors caused by copy-pasting in emails, shuai suggested creating a .txt file locally first, where the email template can be edited and modified before copying it into the email editor. He also created a <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/shuashuai/apache-release-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo of Apache release email templates</a> to help other release managers avoid encountering such problems in the future.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>When waiting for a General vote takes longer than expected, a REMINDER email can be sent for kindly notice. However, it is recommended to prioritize seeking vote from mentors.</p>
<!-- --><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="https://answer.apache.org/assets/images/reminder-tips-3883e7d93a17f52afb26b3f818748ea7.png" width="604" height="391" class="img_RAU7"></p>
<!-- --><p>In the Apache community, all communication is transparent and traceable, which is incredibly helpful for Release Managers referencing past Apache project release processes and emails. The community atmosphere at Apache is open and friendly, and when issues arise, someone will point them out and help resolve them in the emails. For example, during the General vote phase, a mentor pointed out that the release files uploaded to the SVN repository were incorrect, with the signed files having a size of 0. After several rounds of checks, it was found that the release manager had not properly downloaded the release files, and the browser had restricted the content, causing the downloaded files to be incorrect.</p>
<!-- --><p>When talking to the release managers, all of them have mentioned the importance of collaboration and cooperation among release managers. Besides meticulous and repeated checks during the release, it is highly recommended to invite other release managers to help validate the release to ensure that every step is correct.</p>
<!-- --><p>One of the graduation checklist items in Apache's successful graduation guide is the ability to release an Apache version. This requires not only clear release documentation and a transparent communication mechanism but also the collective effort of all community members. From requirement analysis, development, and testing to the final release, the collaboration among community members is key to ensuring a successful release. Apache Answer welcomes and encourages more people to join the community to help build a better Q&amp;A platform software together.</p>]]></content>

It thrives on diversity and that's why we believe that there's always a place for you. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, your contributions-code, documentations, or shining ideas-are valuable.</p>
<!-- --><p>To make it easier for beginners, we've listed our projects on platforms like <!-- --><a href="https://ovio.org/project/apache/incubator-answer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ovio</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://www.libhunt.com/r/incubator-answer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibHunt</a>, and <!-- --><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/incubator-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SourceForge</a> for easier discovery.

<!-- --><p>We've built a <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/render-markdown-codehighlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code highlighting plugin</a> using React and highlight.js. The plugin offers real-time syntax highlighting for a wide range of programming languages and supports dynamic theme switching. Users can choose from popular themes like GitHub Light and GitHub Dark, or create their own custom themes.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ArXL" id="how-did-you-break-down-the-development-of-this-plugin">How did you break down the development of this plugin?<!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/blog/behind-the-plugin-meet-the-student-contributors#how-did-you-break-down-the-development-of-this-plugin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How did you break down the development of this plugin?" title="Direct link to How did you break down the development of this plugin?">​</a></h2>
<!-- --><p>There are several phases as below. First, we started with a simple implementation of code highlighting in the project itself. Once this was working, we moved forward to transforming it into a single plugin.</p>
<!-- --><p>Since plugins mostly deal with the front-end stuff, we focused on that first. After we got the basic highlighting running, we added customization which allows users to choose their preferred theme from the backend. To make that happen, we set up an interface between the front-end and back-end.</p>
<!-- --><p>To sum up:</p>
<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li>Import highlight.js and implement basic code highlighting on the front-end.</li>
<!-- --><li>Migrate the code highlighting feature into a plugin. Well, Vite's bundling got in the way of importing all the CSS we needed, so we had to use CSS-in-JS instead.</li>
<!-- --><li>We noticed that switching to the light theme and the preview box under Question weren't working smoothly. So, we tweaked some dependencies and added more responsive listeners to fix it</li>
<!-- --><li>Once the front-end was stable, we turned our attention to the backend. We created a form for users to select their preferred themes.</li>
<!-- --><li>By modifying the frontend-backend interface, we were able to dynamically apply the selected themes.</li>
<!-- --><li>When testing, we identified performance issues related to CSS loading. To optimize performance, we switched to a dynamic import and mapping approach to reduce CSS load times.</li>
<!-- --><li>Finally, for better maintainability and readability, we wrote code to parse the core library and automate theme detection, classification, and switching."</li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ArXL" id="how-do-you-solve-the-problems-encoutered-in-the-process">How do you solve the problems encoutered in the process?<!-- --><a href="https://answer.apache.org/blog/behind-the-plugin-meet-the-student-contributors#how-do-you-solve-the-problems-encoutered-in-the-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do you solve the problems encoutered in the process?" title="Direct link to How do you solve the problems encoutered in the process?">​</a></h2>
<!-- --><p>Yes, there were a few challenges during development. For instance:</p>
<!-- --><ul>
<!-- --><li><strong>CSS Loading:</strong> Importing multiple CSS stylesheets was a problem because of Vite's packaging limitations. We overcame this by adopting a CSS-in-JS solution.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li><strong>Theme Switching:</strong> The preview box below the Question wasn't in real-time rendering when switching between light and dark modes. To resolve this, we optimized dependencies and implemented more robust event listeners.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li><strong>Backend Integration:</strong> Integrating the backend form with the frontend was another hurdle. We solved this by leveraging the Answer API to facilitate data exchange between the front-end and back-end.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li><strong>Code Maintenance:</strong> To streamline future maintenance, we implemented file traversal to read the core library instead of manual imports.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ul>
<!-- --><p>By addressing these issues, we were able to enhance the plugin's performance and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies.</p>

<!-- --><p>Working on open-source projects has taught us the importance of community and collaboration. Every little thing you do, like writing code or sharing ideas, helps make Answer better. It's not just about knowing how to code; you also need to be good at talking to other people. When you work together, you can make sure everything works right, especially when fixing problems.</p>
<!-- --><p>We've learned that having great coding skills isn't enough. You need to really understand how the project works inside and out. That means learning from others and using their ideas. Open source isn't just about sharing tech; it's about sharing ideas and being creative. It helps everyone get better and makes us want to do our best</p>

<!-- --><p>Working on these projects has helped us truly understand how open source works and the importance of teamwork. We think students should definitely get involved in open source projects. It's a great way to learn and practice coding.</p>
<!-- --><p>By contributing, students can get real-world experience, solve real problems, and meet other people in tech. Start small and work your way up.

<!-- --><p>CommunityOverCode (formly known as ApacheCon) is the official global conference series of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Since 1998 – before the ASF’s incorporation – ApacheCon has been drawing participants at all levels to explore "Tomorrow’s Technology Today" across 300+ Apache projects and their diverse communities. CommunityOverCode showcases the latest developments in Apache projects and emerging innovations through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, trainings, hackathons, and more.</p>

<!-- --><p>Make the best use of social media to extend the reach, especially for global community members. Send an event preview, schedule, and invitation to your followers to drop by and connect.</p>

<!-- --><p>In GitHub Open Source Spotlight area, we were offered a table with space for a laptop and keyboard connected to a display.</p>
<!-- --><p>A live demo is invaluable, and Meta Answer is the demo already.

<!-- --><p>While the demo is a live experience for the visitors, prepare takeaways for them to recall your project. Flyers and several stickers are efficient.</p>
<!-- --><p>Flyers can provide a quick overview of your project. You can include highlights, social media accounts, and fun facts on the flyers. Stickers are a fun way to leave a lasting impression, and a way to promote your product on the surface of a laptop.</p>
<!-- --><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alt text" src="https://answer.apache.org/assets/images/Flyer-73faeb759d6e131d762fd3f3d2ba6eff.png" width="1080" height="1440" class="img_RAU7"></p>
<!-- --><p>Rushing for our flight, we left a "help yourself" note with our flyers and stickers.</p>

<!-- --><p>Listen and record questions, suggestions, and feedback. Categorize and share it with the community. Ask community members to discuss or leave the answers, and vote for the best answers. Gradually, you will have a FAQ list for your next event so that whoever participates the conference can prepare in advance for the questions.</p>
<!-- --><p><em>Sounds familiar, right? Answer is a great tool for this.</em></p>

<!-- --><p>We hope these tips help your open-source project shine at the next big event. Remember, it's all about making meaningful connections and showcasing the value you bring to the developer community.</p>
