            <description><![CDATA[Let's discuss the design and implementation of the plugin system for Answer, and know why we design this way.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="mb-4"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2023-07-22-cover@4x-adfc331ff0caa372bd48d7c798155678.png" class="rounded img_FEsO" width="1280px" height="720px"></div><blockquote><ol><li>Why is Answer's plugin system designed in such a way that it seems a bit difficult to use?</li><li>How can I implement plugin functionality using Golang?</li><li>What exactly does Answer's plugin system do when it is compiled and packaged?</li></ol></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h2><p>You can build a Q&amp;A community using Answer easily. However, the basic features of Answer may not sufficiently support to every use case.
Therefore, we need to design a plugin system to extend its features.
As you may know, Answer is built using <code>React.js</code> and <code>Golang</code>. Both these languages require compilation. So designing a plugin system is a bit difficult.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="goal--features">Goal &amp; Features<a href="#goal--features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Goal &amp; Features" title="Direct link to Goal &amp; Features">​</a></h2><p>The goal of Answer's plugin system is to provide a <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>extendable</strong> architecture that can accommodate a wide range of use cases. Some of the key features of the plugin system include:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="connectors">Connectors<a href="#connectors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Connectors" title="Direct link to Connectors">​</a></h3><p>By default, Answer supports login via email and password. Within the plugin system, developers can easily integrate other authentication, such as GitHub.</p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/answer-plugin-connector-bc65790664a0b5e0d065ed7448d5429c.png" alt="install-choose-language" width="400" class="img_FEsO"><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="storage">Storage<a href="#storage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Storage" title="Direct link to Storage">​</a></h3><p>Out of the box, Answer stores files in the local file system. However, there could be scenarios where users might prefer to save their uploaded files to a cloud storage service like <code>S3</code>. This can be achieved by the plugin system.</p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/answer-plugin-storage-5665a6432f5cacaaef81d7bcc8128555.png" alt="install-choose-language" width="400" class="img_FEsO"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="implementation">Implementation<a href="#implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation">​</a></h2><p>Now, let's explore how the plugin system is implemented, followed by the reasons behind our design decisions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="details">Details<a href="#details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Details" title="Direct link to Details">​</a></h3><p>The general process is as follows:</p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/answer-plugin-build-brief-870a86d5966ae754f1a166604524137e.png" alt="install-choose-language" width="400" class="img_FEsO"><p>Here are the steps involved in implementing a plugin:</p><ol><li>Generate a <code>main.go</code> file.</li><li>Import the specific plugin list.</li><li>Execute <code>go mod tidy</code> and <code>go mod vendor</code> to manage dependencies.</li><li>Copy the UI directory.</li><li>Overwrite the <code>index.ts</code> file.</li><li>Execute <code>pnpm install</code> and <code>pnpm build</code> to manage the package and build the project.</li><li>Merge the <code>i18n</code> file from the plugin with the original <code>i18n</code> file.</li><li>Build a new binary.</li><li>Clean up the byproducts generated during the build process.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="answer-plugin-build-all.png" src="/assets/images/answer-plugin-build-all-419696fc6220d13e784931f52c29a9fd.png" width="1862" height="846" class="img_FEsO"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="reason">Reason<a href="#reason" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason" title="Direct link to Reason">​</a></h3><p>Here are the reasons behind our design choices:</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="static-compilation">Static Compilation<a href="#static-compilation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Static Compilation" title="Direct link to Static Compilation">​</a></h4><blockquote><p>This is the main reason why the plugin system is designed this way.</p></blockquote><p><code>React.js</code> and <code>Golang</code> both these languages require compilation. They are not dynamically executable like some other scripting languages.
So the plugin system should be a static compilation, which means that the application and plugins are compiled together, resulting in a single binary that can be easily distributed and deployed.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="fixed-functionality">Fixed Functionality<a href="#fixed-functionality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fixed Functionality" title="Direct link to Fixed Functionality">​</a></h4><p>The plugin system allows users to add features that are fixed for their specific use cases without changing the core system.
Furthermore, these functionalities persistently remain operational once they are employed.
Therefore, it is sufficient to deliberate on the necessities of their incorporation at the initial stage, and subsequently, package them accordingly.
In the future, we can build a Docker image that contains all official plugins, thereby enabling users to access the entire range of features. The enablement or disablement of these functionalities can be managed through the plugin control interface.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="extension">Extension<a href="#extension" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Extension" title="Direct link to Extension">​</a></h4><p>The most important capability of a plugin system is its extensibility.
A program can't provide all the functions that every user wants.
However, with a plugin system, users can develop their plugins to help them achieve the functions that they want.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="reference">Reference<a href="#reference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reference" title="Direct link to Reference">​</a></h2><p>The Caddy is a great open-source software that inspired the design of the Answer plugin system.
Caddy is a web server that allows developers to extend its functionality using plugins.
Using <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xcaddy</a> can easy to make custom builds of the Caddy Web Server. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="more">More<a href="#more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More" title="Direct link to More">​</a></h2><p>In this blog post, we discussed the design and implementation of the plugin system for Answer, a popular open-source Q&amp;A platform.
We discussed the motivation behind the design, and the features and principles of the plugin system, and provided a step-by-step guide on implementation.
If you are interested in developing plugins for Answer, please feel free to leave us a comment.
We will also write an article on how to implement an Answer plugin from scratch, so stay focused!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Obviously, not every question needs a team to solve, which makes self-service effective (a support team is still needed). That’s what help center comes for: provide the right information, in a right approach, at the right time for your customers. </p><p>In today’s blog, we will build a help center from the scratch with a bit of community sprit in Answer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="whats-a-help-center">What’s a Help Center<a href="#whats-a-help-center" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s a Help Center" title="Direct link to What’s a Help Center">​</a></h2><p>A Help Center serves as a valuable resource for users. It provides customers immediate help by helping them find answers and resolve issues independently.</p><p>When building a help center, here are 2 common questions you need to address:  </p><p><strong>What types of answers or help do users require?</strong><br>
<strong>How can they always get the answers they require?</strong><br>

For users, finding the correct answer can be challenging. Similarly, administrators face the pressure of maintaining, and running an effective help center.</p><p>However, in Answer, everything is entirely different from traditional help center.
In Answer, <strong>everyone can ask and respond</strong>, creating a mutual way interaction. Every user can ask a question, contribute, vote for an answer, etc. Here, the user is no longer waiting for answers passively, but becomes a part of help center management. This also alleviates the pressure of administrators, allowing them to focus on the roadmap of the help center.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="build-a-help-center-with-answer-tutorials-and-tips">Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)<a href="#build-a-help-center-with-answer-tutorials-and-tips" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)" title="Direct link to Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)">​</a></h2><p>The essence of a help center is to provide the right answer to the problems occurring already, and Answer is born for this.

You can use it to build a platform in the form of Q&amp;A. No matter a knowledge base, product forum, a support, Answer got it covered.

<!-- -->Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.
Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence.

<!-- -->The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and "know-how" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices.
Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.

<!-- -->Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.<br>
<!-- -->Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship.

It requires creating a culture that values collaboration and providing tools for easy exchange of knowledge. Here’s how Answer helps for effective knowledge sharing.</p><ol><li><p>Open and Collaborative Culture<br>
<!-- -->Encourage and value knowledge sharing for everyone on the team. The essence of Answer is open source, and the Q&amp;A platform itself is open and collaborative.
In Answer, you can customize the layout and add rules in the sidebar to remind everyone subtly.

</p></li><li><p>Make Knowledge Accessible<br>
<!-- -->In Answer, sharing and accessing to knowledge is like breathing. Everyone is a loop of knowledge sharing: add a question, provide answer, upvote, etc. This fosters a collaborative spirit for the community naturally.

<!-- -->Besides knowledge storage, and creation, knowledge management is the key that keeps your platform running. In Answer, you can manage different types of knowledge by tags. You can find tags are like troops, guarding each question so that you can identify the category you need immediately.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="mb-4"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2023-05-30-cover@4x-c3ddcda375a87cf9237d2704b5f80692.png" class="rounded img_FEsO" width="1280px" height="720px"></div><p>We’ve discussed knowledge retention is the challenge of today, since knowledge scatters like fragments of a grand puzzle, waiting to be discovered and connected. Besides having a knowledge sharing platform, running a knowledge base is also an effective strategy for knowledge retention, and the best part is you can build your one with Answer easily.</p><p>If you’re considering having a knowledge base, you’re in the right place. In today’s read, we’ll explain knowledge base, benefits, and a self-host knowledge base built with Answer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="what-is-knowledge-base">What is Knowledge Base<a href="#what-is-knowledge-base" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Knowledge Base" title="Direct link to What is Knowledge Base">​</a></h2><p>In a simple way: a knowledge base is an online library where you can store, organize, and retrieve information easily.</p><p>Sounds big, right? In fact, you must use one of them for sure since a knowledge base takes various forms, such as databases, wikis, documents, articles, FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), manuals, tutorials, or any other structured or unstructured format.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="why-you-need-it">Why You Need it<a href="#why-you-need-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why You Need it" title="Direct link to Why You Need it">​</a></h2><p>We expect to retrieve the right information at the moment, and the process must be quick. That’s why we need a knowledge base that contains a wide range of information and easy-to-search, and check the benefits.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="benefits">Benefits<a href="#benefits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefits" title="Direct link to Benefits">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>Easy Access to Information
A knowledge base provides a structured and organized system for storing information, making it easily accessible to users. It allows quick retrieval of relevant data, reducing the time and effort required to search for information.</p></li><li><p>Improved Productivity and Efficiency
By having a knowledge base in place, employees can find the information they require without relying on others or spending excessive time searching for it. This increases productivity and efficiency in performing tasks by empowering users to find information independently.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge Retention and Sharing
A knowledge base serves as a repository for capturing and preserving institutional knowledge within an organization. It helps to retain critical information even when employees leave or change roles.</p></li><li><p>Consistency and Accuracy
With a knowledge base, organizations can ensure consistency and accuracy in the information. It minimizes errors and conflicts, allowing for standardized procedures, guidelines, and documentation, reducing the risk of errors or inconsistencies caused by outdated or conflicting information.</p></li><li><p>Customer Self-service and Support
Knowledge bases are commonly used in <a href="/blog/2023/07/05/how-to-build-a-help-center-with-your-users-and-answer">customer support</a> to provide self-service options. By offering a comprehensive collection of FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and instructional materials, customers can find solutions to their problems without the need to contact support, reducing support costs and improving customer satisfaction.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GWGz" id="build-knowledge-base-with-answer">Build Knowledge Base with Answer<a href="#build-knowledge-base-with-answer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Build Knowledge Base with Answer" title="Direct link to Build Knowledge Base with Answer">​</a></h2><p>Make sure you have the right tools for hosting and managing your knowledge base.
