### Identify and Prioritize the Knowledge 

Obviously, it’s impossible to retain all the information, since there are different roles and departments in a company, and each plays a different role in the business. 

Identify the secret weapon for your business, and prioritize the key information, skills, and expertise that are most critical to the success of your business. 

Tags help users identify the knowledge they require at the moment. In [Answer](https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1V8/how-to-create-some-tags-without-add-question), admins can create a new tag without adding a question. This is helpful to preparing the foundation of a knowledge base.
