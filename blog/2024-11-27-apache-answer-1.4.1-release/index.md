The weather is getting colder, and time to light up the knowledge fireplace. In this release, we add new features to provide context for your knowledge flow in an easy way. There're also improvements in different ways: display, color, SEO template, etc. Don't miss the 4 new plugins that streamline Answer with the tools you love.

## Linking Question: Connect the Knowledge Dots

By linking similar/related questions, users can easily explore relevant discussions and find additional context. This feature not only improves the experience but also strengthens the community by fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.

### How to   
Simply copy and paste the string of the question/answer you want to link to the editor, and add # before it.
