2024 has been treated us well — we have more stars and contributors illuminating the path ahead of us.

As a 1-year-old project, we started our journey with the dream of making everyone find the best answer like breathing, as well as, unlocking the collective wisdom for teams at any scale.

We welcome new contributors to join our open-source journey. No matter your skill level or background, there's always a place for you in our community. Whether you want to code, write documentation, share your expertise, or simply offer feedback, your contributions will help us shine even brighter. 

## Why Apache Answer
We are a group of Q&A enthusiasts, and it’s lovely to deliver a product that we truly love. Answer is an open-source Q&A software aiming to help people find the right answers, while unleashing collective wisdom for every team.

We’ve tagged different issues for novices and veterans to get hands on in the [repository](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/issues).

We know how important it is to have well-written and complete documentation to guide you. The Contributing doc covers everything you need, from how to submit an [issue](https://answer.apache.org/community/issues), to develop a [plugin](https://answer.apache.org/community/plugins), and how to write a [blog](https://answer.apache.org/community/blog-post).
