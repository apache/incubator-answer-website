## What is Knowledge Sharing?

[Knowledge sharing ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing)is an activity through which knowledge (namely, information, skills, or expertise) is exchanged among people, friends, peers, families, communities, or within or between organizations. 

Answer is a platform for knowledge sharing, and the form of asking and answering is a natural way of knowledge sharing. The information in Answer can be documented for every user to check. Admins can modify them for keeping them up-to-date. 

## 3 Types and Ways of Knowledge Sharing
01. Explicit Knowledge          
	Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.
	Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence. 
   

02. Implicit Knowledge            
	The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and "know-how" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices. 
	Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.

03. Tacit Knowledge                
	Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.   
	Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship.

3. Effective Knowledge Management  
	Besides knowledge storage, and creation, knowledge management is the key that keeps your platform running. In Answer, you can manage different types of knowledge by tags. You can find tags are like troops, guarding each question so that you can identify the category you need immediately.

	In Answer, we’ve automated the [reputation system](https://answer.dev/docs/recipes/contents/reputation), encouraging ownership and motivation to share valuable insights. Users can earn reputation scores by asking questions that everyone concerns, receiving votes from other users, answers accepted. It’s a reflection of how active you are in the community. With more reputation scores, you’ll unlock more features, such as upvote, invite an answer, edit other’s question, etc.

5. Feedback and Evaluation  
	Encouraging feedback loops and continuous improvement for your community. Once you've obtained a sufficient reputation score, you can start voting for questions or answers, providing feedback to enhance its quality and relevance.
